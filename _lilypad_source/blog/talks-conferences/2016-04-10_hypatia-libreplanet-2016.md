# LibrePlanet 2016 Hypatia Talk

I got a chance to speak about the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org),
at LibrePlanet 2016 (at MIT) thanks to Brian Callahan. It was a magical journey! I took the car all the way from
Minneapolis to Boston to give this talk! I got a chance to speak with Richard Stallman for a long while.

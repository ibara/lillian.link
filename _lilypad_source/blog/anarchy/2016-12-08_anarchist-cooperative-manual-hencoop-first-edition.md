## Abstract/Summary

## Foreword

Marginalized people are finding empowerment in communities that share ownership of an
organization. ["Generative Justice"](https://generativejustice.wikispaces.com/) can crudely
be defined as a member-owned cooperative formed to empower its marginalized members. Here's
a definition of Generative Justice from the [Generative Justice Wiki](https://generativejustice.wikispaces.com/):

<blockquote>
The universal right to generate unalienated value and directly participate in its benefits;
the rights of value generators to create their own conditions of production; and the rights
of communities of value generation to nurture self-sustaining paths for its circulation.

Generative Justice is a large umbrella covering many organizational models, with this
article I hope to impart my experiences with anarchist cooperatives in particular. I also submit
my proposal for an anarchist cooperative model for generative justice, based on aforesaid
"experiences."

As a model for marginalized peoples' self-empowerment, consensus-based anarchist
cooperatives put both organizational ownership and governance in the hands of those
marginalized peoples. Ultimately, consensus-based anarchist cooperatives allow every member to
incorporate their voice into all decisions while receiving just compensation and property,
which marginalized people are often cheated out of, or restricted from.

This article and the Anarchist Cooperative Manual provided herein hopes to offer both
beneficial, explicit, and nuanced instruction on implementing consensus-based anarchist
cooperatives for the purpose of empowering marginalized people.

Anarchy, at least the way I find useful thinking of it, is the belief that the people
collectively best govern themselves and best represent their interests especially as
a group. To quote Peter Kropotkin:

<blockquote>
In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies,
and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood,
of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of
existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species.
The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest
limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...]
are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further
progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of
attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development,
and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species,
its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the
contrary, are doomed to decay.

<cite>— Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion.</cite>
</blockquote>

My interpretation of the above quote is that cooperation not only allows self-mending of
the group, but it propells them forward by this behavior, and that such is foundational in
our species' success.

An organizational model which is both governed and owned by its members is an anarchy. That
is, I choose to interpret anarchy as participation of the people composing government authority,
explicitly in omission of reprentatives. Thus, every member has equal control (governance) and
property (revenue, assets, etc.), together making decisions as "the cooperative," a strict set
of bylaws preventing any particular member from arbitrarily deciding on behalf of the membership as
a whole. Anarchy has a history of being utilized by marginalized peoples, e.g, anarcha-feminism,
as most agreeably explained here:

<blockquote>
Anarcha-feminism [...] combines anarchism with feminism.
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy, that should
be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against
patriarchy is an essential part of class conflict and the anarchist struggle against the state.
In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle
and vice versa. L. Susan Brown claims that, "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes
all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist."

<cite>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcha-feminism">Anarcha-feminism, Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>

Consensus is when proposals are both built and officiated by the participation of all participants.
In contrast, unanimity is where proposals are consented to without block or voted unanimously, but
the proposal is *not* constructed by all participants. Consensus can be a ground-up approach of
crowdsourcing strategy and planning, but also leaves rooms for formalized proposals to be elaborated
on by all participants.

[Wikipedia's article on Women in Cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_cooperatives) is plentiful
with great information:

<blockquote>
(A cooperative is) an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual, social, economic,
and cultural benefit through a mutually owned and democratically run enterprise.

[...]

Cooperatives are based on values like self-help, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity. These values,
among other aspects of cooperatives, are particularly useful in empowering women through membership.

Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create
economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market.

</blockquote>

However, a model of governance alone is insufficient, you must also have good goals and people who
believe in them! Crowdsource those believers for delicate planning, insight to cement member protections
and benefits, to establish calculated checks and balances. In general the goals and their believers should
be the organization's guiding star.

## The Anarchist Cooperative Manual (First Edition)

The Anarchist Cooperative Manual is available in two formats:

  * [Anarchist Cooperative Manual (??? Edition on Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4MC0se1ZEo7U-sVYCyS9JDbQLPJ9dJsIa-pMwZgSxY/edit?usp=sharing)
  * [Anarchist Cooperative Manual (First Edition) PDF download](anarchist-cooperative-manual-first-ed.pdf)

I created the first edition for [Hen Coop](http://hencoop.org), where hopefully soon it'll undergo discussion at
a town-hall-type meeting. Community input will be crucial in the development of this manual, I will keep this blog
updated with any such developments.

## Challenges

I've made many mistakes with cooperatives and this section elaborates on them, the general hurdles
anarchist cooperatives face. Among the biggest is not utilizing community input as often as possible
and not realizing my own limitations. By consulting the community you make things easier on yourself,
tasks become more accomplishable, contributors feel a sense of ownership, information is diffused,
and the results are better. You'll be surprised what people will take off your hands. Be sure to
act as a shining example of a good member. Explicitly adhere to the rules, don't cut corners, take
things slowly.

Make sure members are never surprised about changes within the cooperative. Again, take it slow and steady,
make sure all members have a chance to participate and revise, revise, revise! For example, even if all
members participating in a meeting decide to make drastic changes, try to avoid implementing them suddenly
and without further discussion, otherwise members can feel lost or left out. There should be steps taken to
ensure big changes are made slowly, that people given plentiful chance to offer their input, and that plans
are announced routinely to the membership with due notice.

A consistent failure I've seen and made was an unpreparedness and thus inability to handle interpersonal
conflict. Without a robust system for mediating such incidents, conflict has high potential to tear the
cooperative apart. It is unrealistic to imagine the personal and official to be separate realms, for
in reality they intermingle and one completely affects the other.
Members are the synecdoche of operations, of the
cooperative at large, and as such it is a mutual relationship between emotion and official business.
To put it differently, the members are representative of the cooperative as a whole, and that the cooperative
itself is representative of its members; the way you operate as a group is a bidirectional relationship. For
example, you may find group activities that involve members interacting one-on-one (as
with a chess club) are effective providers of group cohesion, or that success as a
cooperative imparts a comradery among its members, who own that success, "We did this." Humans are humans,
and humans need very special care and handling, it's important that the cooperative reflects this.

There's an inherent power or authority in any organization, as Jo Freeman explains in "The
Tyranny of Structurelessness," and that it is important to make those powers accountable and transparent.
There are many ways in which I failed to actually distribute ownership and control, so I often acted as
a clandestine authority. I also failed to constantly incorporate everyone's input at any and every turn,
which is so essential to accomplish member ownership and control, and for them to recognize their governance and
property in the cooperative, even if it can be slower at times. It always starts slow, and that's ok.

A lack of goals, starting a group without a concrete mission and set of goals creates an indefinite amount
of directionlessness, to call back to what I said earlier: your organization's health is its goals and
the supporters who believe in them.

A lack of accountability/responsibility of actions decided as a membership was another crucial flaw. Things were
decided upon, but there was no action done to execute it; it is crucial that all planning be met with equal accountability.

There are simpler problems with an anarchist cooperative as well, there's a difficulty with sharing resources among
members, especially members-only materials (manuals, meeting minutes, calendar, etc.), time management during meetings,
legally distributing ownership/property/governance, etc. Often it boils down to ownership, such as, who ultimately
controls the...

  * ... calendar?
  * ... website/domain/server/etc?
  * ... documents (as with Google Docs, etc.)?
  * ... email and other accounts?
  * ... money (most complicated of all!)?

There's also a lot of legal headaches involved with empowering every member as equal owners of the cooperative.

Finally, and why I wrote this article to begin with: there's a serious lack of research and documentation regarding
anarchist cooperatives, so even if you wanted to go in prepared, much is left to your intuition.

## Triumphs

In my experience, I'm proud to say that the cooperatives I've founded have established invaluable friendships
and connections for various members. Those cooperatives genuinely empowered and were of great help to
some marginalized people. The cooperatives even received some noteriety, I even talked about Hypatia Software Organization
at LibrePlanet 2016 and Slime Mom at Transh4ck #ibuild4. The cooperatives consistently raised a good amount of
money for operations. Meeting minutes were always recorded, and by a variety of people, and that those documents
were made accessible to all members.

I'd often take an observer role in meetings to see how smoothly they'd run without me.
Everyone did a wonderful job adhering to the rules and carrying out the meetings, even
instructing others on the rules. People were speaking their minds and those voices were
incorporated into the cooperative's decisions.

I really love the process of consensus, because it's a decision process that feels like a natural and real dialog.
Concerns are more likely to be raised and addressed. Also, we're wiser as a group and a diverse set of perspectives
is invaluable. Holding meetings which were mostly open discussion seemed most rewarding to everyone. It was important
to have an "empath" role, a person to relay concerns of those who are unable to (for any reason) address the meeting
participants directly. It's important to put extra care into a delicate system of blocking consensus.

Also, the anarchist cooperative model has resonated with so many marginalized people in a unique way I did not initially expect. I strongly
believe there's something important in this field yet to be explored and discovered, as it is so woefully under-researched.

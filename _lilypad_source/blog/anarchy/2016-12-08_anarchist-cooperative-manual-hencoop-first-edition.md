# Anarchist Cooperative Manual (First Ed.)

I have been experimenting with anarchist cooperative structures ever since I founded
[Hypatia Software Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org/). There have been a lot
of challenges along the way, namely efficiency and organizational clarity. I hope from
this manual you can avoid many of the hurdles I've encountered.

I'll try to keep this blog post up-to-date, routinely updating it with more complete
information, at least until the new edition is published.

## Challenges

### Ownership

One of the biggest issues boils down to ownership. Here are some ownership issues,
who ultimately controls the...

  * ... calendar?
  * ... website/domain/server/etc?
  * ... documents (as with Google Docs, etc.)?
  * ... email and other accounts?

The most problematic of all in this subset of ownership issues is of course... *money*.

Trying to run a cooperative where everyone owns equal share of revenue/governence/ownership is
_really hard_ and incompatible with law. You can use various techniques to make it compliant,
though. The laws vary state-to-state, and I'm not about to dish up any legal advice.

## My mistakes

Here are some major pitfalls I encountered prior when experimenting with anarchist structures,
for which I am completely to blame due to my lack of foresight and patience:

  * Inability and unpreparedness to handle social/interpersonal incidents
  * Responsibility, accountability of actions decided as a membership
  * Changing "the system" of participation too rapidly, to the point where members are too confused to participate
  * Lack of goals, concrete mission; lack of direction
  * Difficulty in sharing resources with others (manuals, meeting minutes, calendar, other member-only stuff)
  * Time management during meetings. A clear cut schedule must be adhered to.

## My triumphs

  * Meeting minutes were always recorded, and by a variety of people, made accessible to everyone
  * Consensus turned out to be my favorite method, over both voting (supermajority, Condorcet, etc.),
    and consent (just say no if you don't want this to happen)
  * Other people actually did each of the meeting roles without me helping them
  * Some people actually got good help, which made it all worth it

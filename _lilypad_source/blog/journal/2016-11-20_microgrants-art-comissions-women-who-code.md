# Microgrants, Art Comission, and Women Who Code

Today I got a microgrant from [Abe/Mecha Elephant](http://mechaelephant.com/microgrant) to work on "free/libre" work specifically, so I've decided to use the grant to work on [Sappho](https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/sappho), my 2D game engine (Python), for a full day. I'm planning on implementing line-based collisions and spacial partitions. Spacial partitions is a collision optimization where you divide up the map/screen/whatever into cells ("partitions"), which allows you to only collision test other collidable entities within the same cells. Line-based collision testing is very fast, it's useful to do before a mask collision check (which is both pixel-perfect and intensive). Thank you Abe!

[Di Theis (@ditheis on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ditheis) has commissioned me to do a quick art piece for a collection called [trans architecture: redoing the genderbread dough: the true architecture of trans persona online](http://ditheis.com/transarchitecture/). It was noted that they liked my reappropriated tranny smut net piece, [Dayglo Witch (Content Warning: NUDITY!)](http://dayglowitch.lillian.link/).

I attended the [Women Who Code Twin Cities HackNight](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Twin-Cities/events/233254929/?gj=co2&rv=co2) on November 16. Sarah Olson ([@saraheolson on Twitter](https://twitter.com/saraheolson)) hosted, she's the director of [Women Who Code Twin Cities (@WWCodeTC on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/wwcodetc). The event was really good; it's a great resource for women, they're explicitly chill with trans women, I encourage you check out your local [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/).

<p>So I made my first real release of Zoe &amp; Molly on GitHub, specifically
<a href="https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/zoe-and-molly/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Release 0.1.0 "Choo Goo."</a>
I call it that because there's a lot of slime and also a train minigame.
Please keep in mind this is a rough draft of a very incomplete game, an early sneak peak.
Here's the official release video:</p>

<p>Zoe &amp; Molly is a game based off of my dreams, I encourage you to read about that in
<a href="/blog/zoe-and-molly/2016-11-10_redid-zoe-slime/">my first blog post about Zoe &amp; Molly</a>.</p>
<p>I try to Tweet regularly to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zoemolly">#zoemolly Hashtag on Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2>How can I play?</h2>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/zoe-and-molly/tree/v0.1.0/distrib">the Zoe &amp; Molly v0.1.0 download page</a>
and follow the instructions in the <code>README.md</code>/on the page there.</p>
<h2>Hows it made?</h2>
<p>I have a lot of details on that on the 
<a href="https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/zoe-and-molly">Zoe &amp; Molly GitHub repo</a>  itself,
but in short, I use a game engine called
<a href="http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page">OHRRPGCE</a>.</p>
<h2>The train minigame</h2>
<p>I had to introduce some scripts in this release, namely for the minigame. The minigame
is a simple board game where you roll the die and you get to move that many spaces
from your current position in any direction. However, you have a limited number of
die rolls. You collect points by ending your turn on a dot/green tile, thus collecting
that tile's point. You win by making it to the goal (yellow tile) with points, on your
last roll.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">end roll on a dot to gain point. play until out of rolls, but if out of rolls &amp; you're not on the goal square, you lose/no points <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zoemolly?src=hash">#zoemolly</a> <a href="https://t.co/cMWBhH91d1">pic.twitter.com/cMWBhH91d1</a></p>â€” SpaceSlimeComplexity (@LilySeabreeze) <a href="https://twitter.com/LilySeabreeze/status/801682343455027200">November 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The script that makes the magic happen is <code>scripts/trainy.hss</code>, which is written in
HamsterSpeak (AKA "plotscripting"), something specific to
<a href="http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page">OHRRPGCE</a>.</p>
<p>Some interesting bits about HamsterSpeak:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no lists or arrays, just global variables #0 to #16383. I used a
    "fake array" to accomplish keeping the move history in the minigame. This
    method is documented in the
    <a href="http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Scripts:Fake_arrays">OHRRPGCE Wiki's "Fake Arrays" article</a></li>
<li>Likewise, strings are stored like globals, whereas a string is created with
    a manually specified integer identifier, and is later referenced by such.</li>
<li><code>th  i s</code> is the same as <code>this</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you wanna read more about HamsterSpeak, be sure to checkout the
<a href="http://hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/plotdictionary.html">Official Dictionary of Plotscripting Commands</a>.</p>
<p>I also wanted to thank the generous people in the OHRRPGCE IRC channel (#slimesalad on
Espernet), including the creator Bob the Hamster, SDHawk, and Harlock199X for their
input and assistance. Some funny tricks used in this script:</p>
<ul>
<li>To see if the goal is achieved I check if the train is over a "vehicle type a"
    tile (if the player is out of rolls)</li>
<li>To gain points, the train moves under dot NPCs. Then, a check at the spot of
    the train NPC is done, for the second NPC result in that area, whereas 0 is
    the backmost and &gt;0 is increasingly foremost.</li>
<li>The way spaces you're allowed to move is calculated by keeping track of directions/
    keys pressed, so that if the opposite is pressed, the history can be undone and more
    movement regained. The spaces are stored in a series of global variables with a
    "fake array" (as mentioned above). Once you return to the original roll value, the
    history is just reset (this solved some bug, I can't remember what...)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have a secret/alternate spriteset for this, that includes a
Burlington Northern SD45 as the train/player's piece. I plan to use this
in a later part of the game (I'll probably touch up later, too).</p>
<p><img alt="The Burlington Northern SD45 Train Walkabout" src="burlington-northern.png"/></p>
<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<p>I've been thinking what I'm going to do with that Daisy character,
if I wanna keep the small walkabout characters for battle, or if I wanna go nuts and
make Daisy the "Zoe" character, and workon battle animations for both Zoe and Molly.</p>
<p>I need to redo a lot of the writing (at least to
have characters talk in a more interesting way than "I AM THING FOR THIS PURPOSE),</p>
<p>I'd really like to make some cutscenes and an intro. Start letting people load and
see a title screen.</p>
<p>I'd also like to make sure I'm intelligently managing my palettes more. The
colors in the crayon world need a real palette.</p>
<p>Other stuff I wanna touch up on before I make a more official "demo" is
better sound effects, bug fixes, add cutscenes (namely intro cutscene),
add title screen, allow people to load saves, polish the minigame.</p>
<p>Eventually make an portable computer that's like a gameboy but takes floppies,
so you can save on the fly. But, I want to make it so in some parts, someone
steals your floppy so you can't save.</p>
<p>Make slime monsters appear once Zoe joins (in random encounters; by tag). Attacking
slime with slime either heals or makes slimes bigger; hurting slimes splits them
into smaller pieces until they die.</p>

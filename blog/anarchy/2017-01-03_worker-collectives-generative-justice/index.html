<h2>Abstract/Summary</h2>
<p>Consensus-based worker collectives have demonstrated real potential to empower
marginalized people by offering veritable co-ownership of an organization.
There is a lack of resources regarding worker collectives, thus I have compiled
a collection of tangential sources and my own anecdotes. This article outlines the
concepts which compose a worker collective, contains my experiences and advice,
and provides three separate implementations of worker collective operations (bylaws).</p>
<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p><a href="https://generativejustice.wikispaces.com/">"Generative Justice"</a> can crudely
be defined as a member-owned cooperative formed to empower its marginalized members. Here's
a definition of Generative Justice from the <a href="https://generativejustice.wikispaces.com/">Generative Justice Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The universal right to generate unalienated value and directly participate in its benefits;
the rights of value generators to create their own conditions of production; and the rights
of communities of value generation to nurture self-sustaining paths for its circulation.

<cite>—<a href="https://generativejustice.wikispaces.com/">Generative Justice Wiki</a></cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Generative Justice is a concept compliant with many organizational models. With this
article I hope to impart my experiences with anarchist cooperatives ("worker collectives")
in particular. I also submit my proposal for an anarchist cooperative model for generative
justice, based on aforesaid "experiences."</p>
<p>As a model for marginalized peoples' self-empowerment, consensus-based anarchist
cooperatives put both organizational ownership and governance in the hands of those
marginalized peoples. Ultimately, consensus-based anarchist cooperatives allow every member to
incorporate their voice into all decisions while receiving just compensation and property,
which marginalized people are often cheated out of, or restricted from.</p>
<p>This article and the Worker Collective Manual provided herein hopes to offer both
beneficial, explicit, and nuanced instruction on implementing consensus-based anarchist
cooperatives for the purpose of empowering marginalized people.</p>
<p>An organizational model which is both governed and owned by its members is an anarchy. That
is, I choose to interpret anarchy as participation of the people composing government authority,
explicitly in omission of reprentatives. Thus, every member has equal control (governance) and
property (revenue, assets, etc.), together making decisions as "the cooperative," a strict set
of bylaws preventing any particular member from arbitrarily deciding on behalf of the membership as
a whole. Anarchy has a history of being utilized by marginalized peoples, e.g, anarcha-feminism,
as most agreeably explained here:</p>
<blockquote>
Anarcha-feminism [...] combines anarchism with feminism.
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy, that should
be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against
patriarchy is an essential part of class conflict and the anarchist struggle against the state.
In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle
and vice versa. L. Susan Brown claims that, "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes
all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist."

<cite>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcha-feminism">Anarcha-feminism, Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>
<p>What I find best to take from anarchy is the belief that the people, collectively as a group,
best govern themselves, law created and maintained by the people. That is to say, representation
removes political power from the group, where representatives increasingly disparage workers' interests.
This is contrary to the Westernized democratic fear that the people must be protected
from themselves, i.e., "mob rule," or "the tyranny of the majority." To quote Peter Kropotkin:</p>
<blockquote>
In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies,
and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood,
of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of
existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species.
The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest
limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...]
are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further
progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of
attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development,
and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species,
its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the
contrary, are doomed to decay.

<cite>— Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion.</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>As there is an evolutionary advantage to cooperation for a species, in its stability and
prosperity of its members, I believe the same advantages are yielded when the "mutual aid"
model is applied to business. In fact, such a business models have existed for a long time,
whereby <em>collectives</em> are a specific form of <em>cooperative</em>. I believe the operations process
which best reflects these advantages are consensus-based anarchist models.</p>
<p>Consensus is when proposals are both constructed and approved by all participants of a discussion.
In contrast, unanimity is when everyone <em>agrees</em> to a proposal, an agreement met via consent (without
block) or by vote. However, unanimity, like any other method besides consensus, fails to incorporate
the construction of the proposal by all participants. Consensus can be a ground-up approach of
crowdsourcing all efforts accompanies by maximal information diffusal, while leaving room for formal
proposals to be elaborated upon by such a process.</p>
<p>However, consensus and anarchy are nothing new to business, "worker collectives" are an established
business model that have been using both consensus and anarchy for years. "Collectives" typically
differ from "cooperatives" in that collectives explicitly lack heirarchy.
<a href="http://cultivate.coop">cultivate.coop</a> explains the difference between a collective (a subset of
cooperative) and traditional cooperative models:</p>
<blockquote>
In cooperatives with hierarchical management structures, every member is also an owner (or every worker,
in the case of worker cooperatives).  The Board of Directors is comprised of and elected by members, but
is empowered to make governance decisions on their behalf.  Where there are managers (who are often either
elected or hired and supervised by the Board) are empowered to make operational (management) decisions. 
However, many worker cooperatives (especially the experience in the UK) do not have managers.

Collectives tend to strive to abolish hierarchy.  This means that all collective members are equally empowered
to participate directly in the governance and management of the organization.  Some roles and decisions may be
delegated, but all members are equal co-managers.  Because all members are equally responsible for the success
or failure of the organization, there is often a rigorous intake process before a newcomer is approved as a
full collective member.  
</blockquote>
<p>... Unfortunately, I haven't found a lot of information about "worker collectives" specifically, but there's
plenty information on "worker cooperatives." Nonetheless, there's a really good set of example bylaws for
a worker collective created by a paragraph of authors,
<a href="http://institute.coop/sites/default/files/SampleWorkerCooperativeBylaws.pdf">"Sample Bylaws for a Worker Cooperative."</a></p>
<p>However, a model of governance alone is insufficient, you must also have good goals and people who
believe in them! Crowdsource those believers for delicate planning, insight to cement member protections
and benefits, to establish calculated checks and balances. In general the goals and their believers should
be the organization's guiding star.</p>
<h2>The Worker Collective Manual</h2>
<p>I created the "Worker Collective Manual" hoping it serves as an easy-to-understand
example of worker collective operations. Its purpose is to provide a means of experimenting
with an cooperative model (i.e., a worker collective), prior to establishing legally with
<em>actual</em> bylaws. "Worker Collective Manual" is based upon
<a href="http://institute.coop/sites/default/files/SampleWorkerCooperativeBylaws.pdf">"Sample Bylaws for a Worker Cooperative,"</a>
which was prepared by the Green Collar Communities Clinic (GC3) of the East Bay Community Law
Center (EBCLC) and by the Sustainable Economies Law Center (SELC) based on Bylaws
created by Tim Huet of Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives and adapted by Jenny
Kassan of K2 Law Group.</p>
<p>The "Worker Collective Manual" contains
specific references to <a href="http://hencoop.org">the Hen Coop cooperative</a>, as it is a proposal for
said cooperative. The manual will (hopefully) be reviewed and collaborated on during a meeting on January
7, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Here it is, the Worker Collective Manual</strong>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/135TKE0kNR5kHmWpyZEKo8RlN4rh_3ib-jeCGdKqjLmk/edit?usp=sharing">Hen Coop's Informal Bylaws</a>.</p>
<p>As a bonus, here's an earlier version I wrote, entitled "The Anarchist Cooperative Manual,"
which is a concept for larger worker collectives, available in two formats:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I've made many mistakes with cooperatives and this section elaborates on them, the general hurdles
anarchist cooperatives face. Among the biggest is not utilizing community input as often as possible
and not realizing my own limitations. By consulting the community you make things easier on yourself,
tasks become more accomplishable, contributors feel a sense of ownership, information is diffused,
and the results are better. You'll be surprised what people will take off your hands. Be sure to
act as a shining example of a good member. Explicitly adhere to the rules, don't cut corners, take
things slowly.</p>
<p>Make sure members are never surprised about changes within the cooperative. Again, take it slow and steady,
make sure all members have a chance to participate and revise, revise, revise! For example, even if all
members participating in a meeting decide to make drastic changes, try to avoid implementing them suddenly
and without further discussion, otherwise members can feel lost or left out. There should be steps taken to
ensure big changes are made slowly, that people given plentiful chance to offer their input, and that plans
are announced routinely to the membership with due notice.</p>
<p>The biggest consistent failure I've made has been an unpreparedness handling interpersonal conflict. The
relationships between each member is the fabric of the collective. Conflict has the probable potential to
destroy the cooperative in an instant. Thus, incident reporting and handling becomes crucial. There must
be official, discrete channels for reporting and resolving interpersonal issues. Resolutions must be decided,
documented, and signed off by at least one accountable member entrusted to do so. Filling an incident report
must be an action highly accessible to all members. On the lighter side of interpersonal member relationships,
there are proactive measures which can be taken, one-on-one activities like chess (chess club), or group activities
like celebrations of the membership's accomplishments (as a whole).</p>
<p>There's an inherent power or authority in any organization, as Jo Freeman explains in "The
Tyranny of Structurelessness," and that it is important to make those powers accountable and transparent.
There are many ways in which I failed to actually distribute ownership and control, so I often acted as
a clandestine authority. I also failed to constantly incorporate everyone's input at any and every turn,
which is so essential to accomplish member ownership and control, and for them to recognize their governance and
property in the cooperative, even if it can be slower at times. It always starts slow, and that's ok.</p>
<p>A lack of goals, starting a group without a concrete mission and set of goals creates an indefinite amount
of directionlessness, to call back to what I said earlier: your organization's health is its goals and
the supporters who believe in them.</p>
<p>Onboarding is very difficult, it is crucial, without a powerful onboarding experience power/ownership may never
leave your hands.
Onboarding is the foundation of generativity, generativity the foundation of any anarchical cooperative.
Without generativity an anarchy ceases to be, it is important that operation information is diffused, else
delapetaded power structures will emerge. Generativity is defined by Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
Generativity in essence describes a self-contained system from which its user draws an independent ability to
create, generate, or produce new content unique to that system without additional help or input from the system's
original creators.

<cite>—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generativity">"Generativity," Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://chronus.com/employee-onboarding-program-guide">Chronus' article, "Employee Onboarding Program Strategies"</a>
breaks down onboarding as a long term learning experience, which must be routinely evaluated. There are short-term
"transactional" onboarding features, such as technology setup, incident reporting, and other immediate information. Then
there are the "relational" onboarding features, such as long term learning (especially with mentoring), exploring a member's
relevance to the cooperative, in-house networking, and more. Chronus defines "relational onboarding" as:</p>
<blockquote>
This type of learning is not something that happens in a day, a week, or even a month. It’s something that happens in small
chunks, over time.

<cite>—<a href="http://chronus.com/employee-onboarding-program-guide">Chronus' article, "Employee Onboarding Program Strategie"s</a></cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Offer chances to learn in small bits over time. Provide chances to be mentored for on-the-job learning over an extended
period, such as mentoring members on participating in member meetings.
Of course, in a worker collective some workers dont' want to learn about operations, depending on your
cooperative that can be okay! Just make sure that a path to understanding operations is accessible to every member.</p>
<p>A lack of accountability/responsibility of actions decided as a membership was another crucial flaw. Things were
decided upon, but there was no action done to execute it; it is crucial that all planning be met with equal accountability.</p>
<p>There are simpler problems with an anarchist cooperative as well, there's a difficulty with sharing resources among
members, especially members-only materials (manuals, meeting minutes, calendar, etc.), time management during meetings,
legally distributing ownership/property/governance, etc. Often it boils down to ownership, such as, who ultimately
controls the...</p>
<ul>
<li>... calendar?</li>
<li>... website/domain/server/etc?</li>
<li>... documents (as with Google Docs, etc.)?</li>
<li>... email and other accounts?</li>
<li>... money (most complicated of all!)?</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a lot of legal headaches involved with empowering every member as equal owners of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Finally, and why I wrote this article to begin with: there's a serious lack of research and documentation regarding
anarchist cooperatives, so even if you wanted to go in prepared, much is left to your intuition.</p>
<h2>Triumphs</h2>
<p>I'm proud to say that the cooperatives I've founded have established invaluable friendships
and connections for various members, including myself. Those cooperatives genuinely empowered and were of great help to
some marginalized people. The cooperatives even received noteriety, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3HswEh4vhM">I talked about Hypatia Software Organization
at LibrePlanet 2016</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HackLoft/status/807010355910156288">Slime Mom at Transh4ck #ibuild4</a>.
The cooperatives consistently raised a good amount of money for operations, through Patreon, FundClub, PayPal donations, etc.
Meeting minutes were always recorded, and by a variety of people, and that those documents
were made accessible to all members. Now that I'm done bragging about my babies I'll move on to some
more reprodicible tips.</p>
<p>I often took an observer role in meetings to see how smoothly they'd run without me.
Everyone did a wonderful job adhering to the rules and carrying out the meetings, even
instructing others on the rules. People were speaking their minds and those voices were
incorporated into the cooperative's decisions.</p>
<p>I really love the process of consensus, because it's a decision process that feels like a natural and real dialog.
Concerns are more likely to be raised and addressed. Also, we're wiser as a group and a diverse set of perspectives
is invaluable. Holding meetings which were mostly open discussion seemed most rewarding to everyone. It was important
to have an "empath" role, a person to relay concerns of those who are unable to (for any reason) address the meeting
participants directly. It's important to put extra care into a delicate system of blocking consensus.</p>
<p>Responsibilities are distributed by means of those who are willing to be held accountable to membership meetings. This
proccess can be automated by allowing member meetings to enact <em>empowered committees</em> which are held accountable by
the membership. For example, you may not want IT concerns to constantly bubble up in member meetings, thus you could
create an empowered IT committee to officiate procedure and bylaws concerning that body of work, accompanied by routine
reports to the membership, by which all actions are repealable by the membership.</p>
<p>Comment boxes are a great way of voicing anonymous concerns, especially if those comments are presented during member
meetings, for example, giving everyone the link to the comment form responses (Google Forms is great!). Make sure everyone
has access to it!</p>
<p>When a communities' cohesion is strong enough, aid arrives naturally; I've personally seen members buy laptops and other
necessities for the less financially fortunate members. Nonetheless, I strongly believe in providing at least one great benefits
program consisting of a percentage of cooperative revenue, such as an emergency HRT medication coverage.</p>
<p>Also, the anarchist cooperative model has resonated with so many marginalized people in a unique way I did not initially
expect. I strongly believe there's something important in this field yet to be explored and discovered, as it is
so woefully under-researched.</p>

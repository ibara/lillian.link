<p>As a model for marginalized peoples' self-empowerment, consensus-based anarchist
cooperatives put both organizational ownership and governance in their hands. Ultimately,
such models allow every member to incorporate their voice into all decisions and receive
just compensation and property, which marginalized people are often cheated out of. This
Anarchist Cooperative Manual hopes to offer a beneficial and explicit instruction on
a specific implementation of consensus-based anarchist cooperation.</p>
<p>Anarchy, at least the way I find useful thinking of it, is the belief that the people
collectively best govern themselves and best represent their interests especially as
a group. To quote Peter Kropotkin:</p>
<blockquote>
In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies,
and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood,
of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of
existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species.
The animal species[...] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest
limits[...] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development[...]
are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further
progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of
attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development,
and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species,
its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the
contrary, are doomed to decay.

<cite>— Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion.</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>What I take from this is the inherent superiority of cooperation mending itself and
propelling itself forward; not to infer we should rely on charity, but that we must
care for and love every human, to value and appreciate them, for it is the very basis
of our species success.</p>
<p>Anarchy is the people's participation consisting government authority. Anarchy is
representing your beliefs instead of electing a representative. <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/barry-hindess/against-concept-of-populism">There is a Western-inspired
fear of the people</a>,
of mob rule and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_lie">noble lie</a>,
that we are incapable of governing impartially due to selfish desire, ignorance, 
or whismsy. However, representatives are in fact not immune from these same dangers, as
history has exemplified, as we see in American politics, but furthermore are suceptible
to a far greater number of social and systematic ills. Plato's belief of that noble lie,
which those select few who govern must be learned and authoratative in superiority over
the people, resonates in the delapetaded class structures of today.</p>
<p>Consensus is...</p>
<p>Cooperation is...</p>
<p>However, it is paramount to realize that a model alone is not enough to ensure a healthy
organization, that it must be met with good goals and people who believe in those goals
to truly succeed socially and otherwise. Delicate planning must be taken to cement
protections of every member, checks and balances, as with any system.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with the anarchist cooperative model sometime
shortly after founding <a href="http://hypatiasoftware.org/">Hypatia Software Organization</a>.</p>
<p>Anarchist groups are susciptible to these general problems:</p>
<p>Consensus is blah. it has these problems</p>
<p>Here's a critique of anarch (tyranny of structurelessness). Core points of book.</p>
<p>time I was running
I have been experimenting with anarchist cooperative structures
ever since I founded
 There have been a lot
of challenges along the way, but also a lot of triumphs, both which I hope to accurately
analyze herein.</p>
<p>namely efficiency and organizational clarity. I hope from
this manual you can avoid many of the hurdles I've encountered.</p>

<p>This was created for <a href="http://hencoop.org">Hen Coop</a>. It is the first release and is set
to be discussed at a town-hall-type meeting. It is important that beyond this initial draft
that it be elaborated on by a community of like-minded people, especially the generally
marginalized. By "like-minded people" I mean people who share your goals with you. Make sure
sure you establish your goals in the beginning, fill your community with people who
believe in those goals, those will be the people who actually help you build cooperatively.</p>
<p>I'll try to keep this blog post up-to-date, routinely updating it with more complete
information, at least until the new edition is published.</p>
<h2>Consensus, Consent, Voting</h2>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Inability, unpreparedness handling interpersonal conflicts</h3>
<p>Not implementing a robust system for mediating incidents within the community is a
very big mistake. It's really nice to pretend that we can all just accomplish a goal
without letter such "petty" affairs interfere. The reality is, that humans are humans,
and humans need very special care and handling, it's important that your oganization
reflect this if you want to create a healthy environment.</p>
<h3>Personal failings</h3>
<p>There are a lot of things I really goofed up, and I hope these tales of caution help
at least one person avoid the same mistakes. In this section I describe the failings
which were completely (or at least mostly) due to me.</p>
<h4>Changing too rapidly</h4>
<p>Changing "the system" of participation too rapidly, to the point where members are too confused to participate</p>
<h4>Implied authority</h4>
<p>Since I started the organization and did the most work, I ended up becoming
an authority figure with authority contorol even if i wanted an anarchist ocooperative.</p>
<p>this isbecause of multiple factors, firstly, in experimenting with
operations too much on my own, it made other sfeel left out, for it to truly
be a cooperative, members must all pool together in such important decisions</p>
<h4>Lack of goals</h4>
<p>Starting a group without a concrete mission or goal creates an indefinate
amount of directionlessness.</p>
<h1></h1>
<ul>
<li>Responsibility, accountability of actions decided as a membership</li>
<li>Lack of goals, concrete mission; lack of direction</li>
<li>Difficulty in sharing resources with others (manuals, meeting minutes, calendar, other member-only stuff)</li>
<li>Time management during meetings. A clear cut schedule must be adhered to.</li>
<li>Challenges with disabilities (demands, stress)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Triumphs</h2>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>One of the biggest issues boils down to ownership. Here are some ownership issues,
who ultimately controls the...</p>
<ul>
<li>... calendar?</li>
<li>... website/domain/server/etc?</li>
<li>... documents (as with Google Docs, etc.)?</li>
<li>... email and other accounts?</li>
</ul>
<p>The most problematic of all in this subset of ownership issues is of course... <em>money</em>.</p>
<p>Trying to run a cooperative where everyone owns equal share of revenue/governence/ownership is
<em>really hard</em> and incompatible with law. You can use various techniques to make it compliant,
though. The laws vary state-to-state, and I'm not about to dish up any legal advice.</p>
<h2>My mistakes</h2>
<p>Here are some major pitfalls I encountered prior when experimenting with anarchist structures,
for which I am completely to blame due to my lack of foresight and patience:</p>
<h2>My triumphs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes were always recorded, and by a variety of people, made accessible to everyone</li>
<li>Consensus turned out to be my favorite method, over both voting (supermajority, Condorcet, etc.),
    and consent (just say no if you don't want this to happen)</li>
<li>Other people actually did each of the meeting roles without me helping them</li>
<li>Some people actually got good help, which made it all worth it</li>
</ul>

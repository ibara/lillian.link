<p>I have been experimenting with anarchist cooperative structures ever since I founded
<a href="http://hypatiasoftware.org/">Hypatia Software Organization</a>. There have been a lot
of challenges along the way, namely efficiency and organizational clarity. I hope from
this manual you can avoid many of the hurdles I've encountered.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>One of the biggest issues boils down to ownership. Here are some ownership issues,
who ultimately controls the...</p>
<ul>
<li>... calendar?</li>
<li>... website/domain/server/etc?</li>
<li>... documents (as with Google Docs, etc.)?</li>
<li>... email and other accounts?</li>
</ul>
<p>The most problematic of all in this subset of ownership issues is of course... <em>money</em>.</p>
<p>Trying to run a cooperative where everyone owns equal share of revenue/governence/ownership is
<em>really hard</em> and incompatible with law. You can use various techniques to make it compliant,
though. The laws vary state-to-state, and I'm not about to dish up any legal advice.</p>
<h2>My mistakes</h2>
<p>Here are some major pitfalls I encountered prior when experimenting with anarchist structures,
for which I am completely to blame due to my lack of foresight and patience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inability and unpreparedness to handle social/interpersonal incidents</li>
<li>Responsibility, accountability of actions decided as a membership</li>
<li>Changing "the system" of participation too rapidly, to the point where members are too confused to participate</li>
<li>Lack of goals, concrete mission; lack of direction</li>
<li>Difficulty in sharing resources with others (manuals, meeting minutes, calendar, other member-only stuff)</li>
<li>Time management during meetings. A clear cut schedule must be adhered to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My triumphs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes were always recorded, and by a variety of people, made accessible to everyone</li>
<li>Consensus turned out to be my favorite method, over both voting (supermajority, Condorcet, etc.),
    and consent (just say no if you don't want this to happen)</li>
<li>Other people actually did each of the meeting roles without me helping them</li>
<li>Some people actually got good help, which made it all worth it</li>
</ul>

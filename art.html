<h2>Computer games</h2>
<p>Lily has made a bunch of computer games, but here's what survived.
Some of these items are incomplete or a "work in progress."

and other computer-related game software on <a href="http://lily.seabreeze.pro">Lily's Resumé</a>.</p>
<h3>Zoe &amp; Molly</h3>
<p>It's more of an artsy and self-expressive game, based on my dreams, nostalgia, and feelings.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/zoe-and-molly">Zoey &amp; Molly on GitHub</a>, which includes
standalone windows executable that runs in WINE, an OSX binary, and a <code>.deb</code>.</p>

<h3>RGB RPG</h3>
<p>Some game I've long forgotten, made in OHRRPCE. I think the main character sprite is derived from Nayru from Zelda Oracle of Ages.</p>
<p><a href="downloads/rgb-zero-release.zip">RGB (.zip)</a> windows standalone executable which works in WINE.</p>

<h2>Tabletop Games</h2>
<p>I've created a few tabletop games! All of them revolve around simplicity and accessibility.</p>
<h3>Space Vixens</h3>
<p>One page tabletop RPG, uses playing cards, one six sided die.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Cells&lt;</h3>
<p>One page tabletop RPG, uses one six sided die, and game maps composed of cells. Plans to eventually release some playing maps along with other expansions. I've played it with friends and it's fun, easy, and quick; we used a chess board to play, with pawns representing traps, and other pieces marking our players.&lt;</p>

</ul>
<h3>IndexCard RPG</h3>
<p>Minimal tabletop RPG rules which fit on 5x3 inch index cards. Includes expansion cards and tools
to create more rules. I played this a lot with friends, it is fun for quick duels, but the majority
of strategy is in how you build your character. <a href="https://github.com/lily-seabreeze/indexcard">IndexCard RPG on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Graphic art</h2>
<p>Some of this content may be disturbing or triggering. A lot of Lily's art is focused
on being a trans woman, sexuality, and mental illness, or just slime.</p>
<h3>transarchitecture Commission</h3>
<p>I was comissioned to do this piece for
<a href="http://ditheis.com/transarchitecture">Di Theis' project "transarchitecture."</a>.
The original line art is someting I found when randomly paging through the "shemale"
tag on some doujin/hentai site. Here's the associated blurb I created
for the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
I found out that I could be a qt dick girl through tranny smut like the source material of this image and on 4chan. My autotranniphilia fully realized my self and understanding of my own womanhood. After talking to the "traps," or "trannies" in these communities, who too found themselves through this kind of smut and objectification, having fucked them with my own objectification and fetishization, was shown to be a tranny, myself.

<h3>Chat Shrine</h3>
<p>There's a chat shrine on this very website! <a href="/chat-shrine.html">Enter the chat shrine of lillian.link</a>!</p>
<h3>dayglo witch (nsfw)</h3>
<p>A single page containing multiple pieces of art reappropriating 90s shemale smut hentai. A shrine to the experience of finding womanhood through the clandestine lense of "tranny" porn. <a href="http://dayglowitch.lillian.link/">View "dayglo witch" website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/art/dayglo-witch.png"/></p>
<h3>Dadaist Electronic</h3>
<p>I made this with Daniel Saylor. <a href="http://dadaist-electronik.lillian.link/">View dadaist electronik website</a>.</p>
